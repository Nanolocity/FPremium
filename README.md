# Plans
Improving download speed and UI design overall

Adding new features such as:

  -Looping songs
  
Fixing up the spaghetti code

# UPDATE
Most likely there was a Discord API change so the current package that I'm using is not compatible with it and it breaks it entirely(if you launch the program it will just launch Discord and crash). Currently I'm working on resolving this issue and I might release a DiscordRichPresence-less version for the time being
